# C3D Alpha Test
 We have a new simplified software in the making for the M3D Crane and Promega Series. This is a simple alternative for users, specially beginners that are not too familair with the duet web controller. We have only tested this software with the Crane Quad but it should work fine with the Bowden and Dual.

# Features
- Clean Material Design Interface
- Queue system to reduce the number of calls to the printer when there is no response. It automatically stops calling the printer and resumes once the printer gets back to us. 
- Uses VUEJS and Electrum. 100% Modern Javascript based combined with CSS and HTML.  
- Simpler controllers to move XYZ
- History of Gcodes sent 
- Manage multiple printers from a single interface 
- Compatible with MACOS, Windows and Linux

- Custom Gcode Dashboard. (Pending)

# Coming Soon
- Send Gcode console
- Custom Gcode Buttons
- Gallery of click to print models
- Native mobile apps coming next
- Single click printer update 

# How can I help?
